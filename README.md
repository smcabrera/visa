Just playing arond with ruby standard and ActiveSupport libraries for dealing with dates. It turns out it's actually a bit tedious to calculate the days that have passed since a current date with a calculator (let's see, January has 31 days, February has 28 days...or is it 29 this year...).

And then of course I got carried way and started exploring the chronic gem.

It might be fun to create a little Single Page Application that uses this--could be a good excuse for playing with angular :-)
